### Suggestion for better game experience

This game uses inputs from the keyboard as we discussed. But since keeping pushed a key on the keyboard won't "spam" it right away you have to wait for a default delay caused by the operative system. You can disable it easily on control panel on the keyboard section by just dragging the delay cursor all the way to quick (both in windows and linux).
